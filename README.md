# virtual-pet

**This is Sarah Slivka's Virtual Pet project for Module 2**

In this project there are five instance variables (name, hungerLevel, thirstLevel, energyLevel, and happinessLevel)

There are four methods for the virtual pet (feed, giveDrink, rest, and play)

There is also a tick() method, which increases hungerLevel and thirstLevel and decreases energyLevel and happinessLevel every time a user selects an option to interact with the virtual pet, with the exception of checking the status of the pet and exiting the program.

I also implemented some unit testing for class construction and the methods as a stretch task

I also added some ASCII art from http://ascii.co.uk/art/scorpion (jgs) to give my virtual pet a visual aspect as another stretch task.
