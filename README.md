# virtual-pet

**Sarah Slivka's Virtual Pet App**

This app has 5 instance variables and 4 methods that can be be invoked by the user. In addition, the code contains a tick() method to denote the passage of time. Tick() only occurs when using the four methods, not for checking the status of the pet or exiting the application.

For stretch tasks, I did unit testing on creating the classes and the methods. 

I also added in some ASCII art to jazz it up a little bit.

In the second commit, I changed the "if" conditionals regarding user input to a switch statement, and removed the "if" statement at the end of the code since the loop would be broken out of by entering a number other than 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
